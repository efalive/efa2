<h2><a name="ch_1" id="ch_1"></a>1. Presentation and steps:</h2>
<h3><a name="ch_1_1" id="ch_1"></a>1.1. Description (based on the last version 
  1.99.9 for GTK2):</h3>
<p> EasyTAG is a utility for viewing and editing tags for MP3, MP2,
FLAC, Ogg Vorbis, MusePack and Monkey's Audio files, and based on a
simple and nice GTK+ interface making tagging easier.</p>
<p> With the tree browser, select quickly the directory to search for
supported files (with or without including sub-directories). All files
found are displayed in a main with a variable background colour to
show, in one glance, the files in the same directory.</p>
<p> A second useful view mode, organizes the files by artist and by
album to have a quick look to all the artists of your collection, and
all albums for each artist.</p>
<p> The interface displays basic file informations taken from the file
header, like bitrate or duration. With the interface, you can as well
edit common tag fields as : title, artist, album, year, track number,
genre and comment which were available into ID3v1.1 and ID3v2.3 tag.
But you can also edit specials ID3v2.3 fields like : disc album,
composer, original artist/performer, copyright, URL, encoder name and
attached pictures.</p>
<p> Three differents scanners allow you to tag automatically from the
filename, rename the file and directory from the tag, and process
fields (for example to change the case). The first two scanners use a
preview to avoid any mistakes and help you when using or creating yours
own patterns.</p>
<p> If necessary you can use one of the both CDDB modes to fill yours
tags with FreeDB servers. First, the automatic way tries to identify
the selected files with the correct CDDB album. Else, a manual search
lets you to search any word in the CDDB database to identify yourself
the right album.</p>
<p> Also, you can load the content of a simple TXT file (containing
filenames) to set name of each file.</p>
<p> Mass tagging is available with the scanners, but also with buttons
to apply a field to all other selected files (small button on the right
of each field).</p>
<p> To prevent mistakes, the undo and redo functions assist the user to
recover the last changes.</p>
<p> The files collection can be export to a play list for Winamp or
XMMS.</p>
<p> With the search window, look for the requested files.</p>
<p> After the various operations over the files, those who were changed
and need to be saved are displayed in red in the list of files.<br>
</p>
<br>
<p>The program depends on the following libraries:</p>
<ul>
  <li> GTK 2.4,</li>
  <li> id3lib to handle MP3 files,</li>
  <li> libogg,</li>
  <li> libvorbis for Ogg Vorbis files,</li>
  <li> libFLAC (with libogg and libvorbis) for FLAC Vorbis files,</li>
  <li> mpeg4ip for MP4 files.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="ch_1_2" id="ch_1"></a>1.2. Basics steps of tagging/correcting tags:</h3>
<p> EasyTAG offers three different &#8220;main&#8221; ways to tag or rename yours
files: manually, automatically with the scanner or automatically with
CDDB. Below is a description of each one.<br>
But note that for better tagging (when tags are empty for example), the
program prefers files classed by albums, than all the files in a same
directory.<br>
Also, it is important to know that the program works only with the
selected files in the list. So when saving, using the scanner, using
the &#8220;small buttons&#8221; and so on, only the selected files are affected,
except when typing manually in one field. </p>
<h4><a name="ch_1_2_1" id="ch_1"></a>1.2.1. Manually:</h4>
<p> Some conditions to use this mode:</p>
<ul>
  <li> files mixed</li>
  <li> not much files</li>
  <li> little changes to do,</li>
  <li> adding pictures to the MP3 tag</li>
</ul>
<p> If you have only some albums to tag, this mode is very easy to use.
Indeed, you have to type directly and manually the strings into each
field.<br>
Of course, when working by albums, some values as the album name, the
year and the genre are the same for all files. So for fastest tagging,
use the &#8220;small buttons&#8221; on the right of each field, to set this value
to all others selected files in one click.<br>
The genre can be selected from the list (list of ID3 genres), but you
can also type your own one.<br>
The year field, offers also a little improvement, because you need to
type only the last numbers. The other part will be filled automatically
according the current century and decade. For example, typing only &#8216;4&#8217;
will display &#8216;2004&#8217;, and &#8216;94&#8217; will display &#8216;1994&#8217;.<br>
To number tracks quickly with the format xx/xx, use the first &#8220;small
button&#8221; with a sharp to renumber automatically the file according its
position in the list (so the order of files is important). Then the
second &#8220;small button&#8221; set automatically the number of files.<br>
For an efficient handling, to pass from one field to the next one, just
press the enter key. The tab key gives focus to the &#8220;small button&#8221;
corresponding to the field. The keys PageUp and PageDown permit to jump
respectively to the previous and next file.<br>
To attach a picture to the file, just select the image file (JPG or
PNG) with the &#8220;+&#8221; button (in the picture tab), or Drag&amp;Drop
directly the picture file in the zone. </p>
<h4><a name="ch_1_2_2" id="ch_1"></a>1.2.2. Automatically with &#8220;Fill Tag&#8221; 
  scanner:</h4>
<p> Some conditions to use this mode:</p>
<ul>
  <li> files sorted by albums</li>
  <li> filenames or parent directory contain tag information (artist,
album, title, &#8230;)</li>
  <li> empty or not correct tags</li>
</ul>
<p> The &#8220;Fill Tag&#8221; scanner uses a pattern to associate words in the
filename and directories with the tag entries. By this way, the tag
fields can be completed automatically by pressing the &#8220;green&#8221; button in
the scanner window or the toolbar. If the tag is partially completed,
use the option &#8220;Overwrite fields when scanning tag&#8221; in the &#8220;Scanner&#8221;
tab of the &#8220;Preferences&#8221; window, to replace all fields by the new
values.<br>
<br>
Each code correspond to a field, following theses rules :</p>
<p>

<p><br>
<br>
Note : to avoid mistakes, it is recommended to use a code only one time
in the pattern.
Of course, like when tagging manually, only the selected files are
processed by the scanner.<br>
You can use the defined patterns in the list, or write yours own
patterns to correspond to the format of yours file names and
directories.<br>
To avoid mistakes when selecting the right pattern, or writing it, a
preview shows immediately the results before to apply the pattern.<br>
If you need some help with the different codes, press the &#8220;Help&#8221; button
(the lifebuoy) to display the legend of each code.<br>
Also, if you want to save yours own patterns, edit or sort then, by
pressing the &#8220;Mask&#8221; button an little editor will be shown on the
scanner window.<br>
<br>
Below an example of use of patterns :
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> a) the following filename :</p>
  <p class="example-text"> &#8220;/mnt/MP3/EVANESCENCE &#8211; Fallen (2003) &#8211;
Rock/01. Going Under.mp3&#8221;</p>
  <p> b) with the pattern :</p>
  <p class="example-text"> &#8220;%a - %b (%y) - %g/%n. %t&#8221;</p>
  <p> c) you will fill the tag with theses strings :</p>
  <ul>
    <li> Artist (%a) =&gt; EVANESCENCE</li>
    <li> Album (%b) =&gt; Fallen</li>
    <li> Year (%y) =&gt; 2003</li>
    <li> Genre (%g) =&gt; Rock</li>
    <li> Track (%n) =&gt; 01</li>
    <li> Title (%t) =&gt; Going Under</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="ch_1_2_3" id="ch_1"></a>1.2.3. Automatically with CDDB:</h4>
<p> Some conditions to use this mode:</p>
<ul>
  <li> files sorted by album</li>
  <li> file audio data must correspond to the original CD (to use the
Automatic Search)</li>
  <li> album found in CD database</li>
</ul>
<p> To use tagging with the CD database, two modes are available.
First, privilege the automatic search, but if it fails to identify the
album, try with the manual search.</p>
<p> Automatic Search</p>
<p> This mode generates the CddbID from the audio files to request the
database. So select all files of the album (and only them) in the right
order (same order of the CD) and press the &#8220;Search&#8221; button.<br>
All the corresponding albums found in the CD database are listed below.
Select a line to display the tracks of this album on the right.<br>
Finally, to fill the tag, select the interesting lines in the last list
and press the &#8220;Apply&#8221; button.</p>
<p> Manual Search</p>
<p> If none album was found with the previous method, your last chance
is to try a search using words (words supposed to by in the artist
name, album name or track name). This search returns the same results
of the search service on the freedb.org site. And may return lot of
lines&#8230;<br>
While browsing the albums list, those which have been already displayed
are shown in red. Press the &#8220;red line button&#8221; to keep only these lines
and remove all other.<br>
When the right album was identified, follow the same method as the
&#8220;automatic search&#8221; to select and apply the album to yours files. </p>
<h4><a name="ch_1_2_4" id="ch_1"></a>1.2.4. Correct tags fields with &#8220;Process 
  Fields&#8221; scanner:</h4>
<p> Some conditions to use this mode:</p>
<ul>
  <li> filename or tag fields filled</li>
  <li> want to correct the case</li>
  <li> want to change some characters</li>
</ul>
<p> This feature is interesting to normalize quickly yours filenames or
tags. For example to fix the case or convert some characters (filename
to lower case and words separated with spaces).<br>
On the top of the window, select the push-down buttons corresponding to
each field to process. And then, press again the &#8220;green&#8221; button to run
the scanner on the selected fields. </p>
<h4><a name="ch_1_2_5" id="ch_1"></a>1.2.5. Automatic corrections:</h4>
<p> Sometimes when loading files, you will note that some files are displayed to
red. This will be due to useless spaces which are automatically stripped in the 
fields.<br>
So it displays the file in red to let you to save the file. Note that you can't 
disable this feature). </p>
<h3><a name="ch_1_3" id="ch_1"></a>1.3. Basics steps of renaming files and directories: 
</h3>
<h4><a name="ch_1_3_1" id="ch_1"></a>1.3.1. Manually:</h4>
<p> Some conditions to use this mode:</p>
<ul>
  <li> little changes to do&#8230; </li>
</ul>
<p>To rename the filenames one by one (as only the selected file can be
changed) enter the new file name, in the field of the &#8216;File&#8217; frame in
the right top of the main window.<br>
The last name remains in the file list up to saving the file. But the
new name is displayed in the file field.<br>
The invalid characters typed (for windows partitions like: &#8216;/&#8217;, &#8217;+&#8217;,
and so on) will be automatically replaced, except if you disable the
option &#8220;Replace illegal characters in filename (for Windows and
CD-Rom)&#8221; in the &#8220;Misc&#8221; tab of the preferences window.<br>
</p>
<p>To rename the directory directly in the browser, use the popup menu
to open the &#8216;Rename Directory&#8217; window and to edit the new name for the
directory. The change takes effect immediately and you can&#8217;t undo it.<br>
The version 1.99.9 adds the ability to rename the directory from tag
with a pattern.<br>
</p>
<p>Note : Unlike the scanner, when renaming manually the directory, the
files aren&#8217;t moved. As the directory is renamed all files (even files
not supported in EasyTAG like jpeg) stay in the directory. </p>
<h4><a name="ch_1_3_2" id="ch_1"></a>1.3.2. Automatically with scanner:</h4>
<p> Some conditions to use this mode:</p>
<ul>
  <li> tags filled</li>
</ul>
<p> With the scanner mode &#8220;Rename File and Directory&#8221;, you can easily
fix names of lot of files and move them into new directories. As the
new file names will be based on the tag values, it is important to have
correct tags.<br>
Like in the &#8220;Fill Tag&#8221; scanner, it uses the same codes to build the
filename structure from the tag entries, following theses rules:</p>

<p></p>
<p>Note : a code can be used several times Of course, like when
renaming manually, only the selected files are processed by the
scanner. The new files name are only visible in the &#8216;File&#8217; frame up to
saving the files.<br>
This scanner also offers the ability to move the files in new or
existing directories, using an absolute or relative path.</p>
<p>Relative path:</p>
<p>By using a relative path, the files will be moved into a
subdirectory of the current directory.<br>
For example,<br>
- the file &#8220;/mp3/evanescence/01. Going Under.mp3&#8221;<br>
- with the pattern &#8220;%a - %b/%n - %t&#8221;<br>
- will be moved to &#8220;/mp3/evanescence/EVANESCENCE &#8211; Fallen/01 - Going
Under.mp3&#8221;<br>
- if tag contains the values %a = EVANESCENCE, %b = Fallen, %n = 01 and
%t = Going Under</p>
<p> Absolute path:</p>
<p> By using an absolute path, the files can be moved in any directory.
The current path of the file can be added to the pattern by pressing
the icon on the left of the field (a directory with a green &#8216;+&#8217;). With
this feature, it is easier to change the current path of the file.<br>
For example:<br>
- the file &#8220;/mp3/evanescence/01. Going Under.mp3&#8221;<br>
- with the pattern &#8220;/mp3/%a - %b/%n - %t&#8221;<br>
- will be moved to &#8220;/mp3/EVANESCENCE &#8211; Fallen/01 - Going Under.mp3&#8221;<br>
- if tag contains the values %a = EVANESCENCE, %b = Fallen, %n = 01and
%t = Going Under</p>
<p> Note: Unlike when renaming manually the directory, the scanner
moves the files to the new destination. So it is important to know that
the files not recognized by EasyTAG will not be moved to the new
directory and will stay in the current location. The files are moved

<p> Like for the tag fields, you can use the CDDB results to apply the
new name to the file. But by this way you can rename only the file
name, and not the path. So you can use the second method. Activate the
&#8216;Rename file&#8217; scanner which will be ran after applying the results. </p>

only tags?</p>

only tag data. When saving a file it will ask you confirmation before
to save the tag and then to rename the file.<br>
To do the same with several files at one time, answer like this to the
confirmation dialog boxes:<br>
- Confirmation to tag write: Check &#8220;Do the same for all files&#8221; and
press &#8220;Yes&#8221;<br>
- Confirmation to rename file: Check &#8220;Do the same for all files&#8221; and
press &#8220;No&#8221;</p>
<p class="question-text">How to see if a field haven&#8217;t been filled?</p>
<p>Two ways are available:<br>
- You can sort the list of files using the corresponding criteria.
Empty fields appear on the top of the list. (Example: &#8220;sort by
ascending artist name&#8221;).<br>
- Use the search window to display all files and identify the &#8220;empty&#8221;
cell. </p>
